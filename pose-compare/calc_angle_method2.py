def calculateAngle(landmark1, landmark2, landmark3):
    '''
    This function calculates angle between three different landmarks.
    Args:
        landmark1: The first landmark containing the x,y and z coordinates.
        landmark2: The second landmark containing the x,y and z coordinates.
        landmark3: The third landmark containing the x,y and z coordinates.
    Returns:
        angle: The calculated angle between the three landmarks.
